# Helpdesk-Tickets
Project was to clean Excel data, analyse and present findings via Powerpoint Presentation and create a dashboard on Google Looker

# Excel Cleaning

Check the data attached. Based on the given data, please do data cleaning, remove all duplicates, incorrect data or irrelevant data.
1. Analyze data
2. Clean data

# Excel Analysis

Based on the cleansed file, can you please identify the following using the basic excel formulas (such as IF, COUNTIFS):
1. Total Tickets per Team
2. Total Tickets per Priority
3. Total Tickets per Type
4. Total Open Tickets
5. Total Resolved Tickets
6. Total Closed Tickets
7. Total Open/Answered Tickets
8. Total Tickets from “Email”
9. Total Tickets from “Web”
10. Total Tickets from “Phone”

Please create a separate worksheet called “Summary” within the same excel file to display the
following output:

1. In the tickets list sheet containing the cleansed data of tickets, add a new column “SLA
Due Date”.
2. Compute SLA for tickets with “Incident/ Problem” types only. For tickets which have
“Request” types, print “No SLA for Request” in the cell.
3. Follow the SLA below:
  1. Emergency - 4 hours
  2. High Priority - 3 business days
  3. Normal - 5 business days
  4. Low - 10 business days
4. Please compute the due date for each ticket excluding weekends.
5. Add another column called “Breached SLA?”.
a. Print “Yes” if SLA Due date is greater than the Last Updated Date. Else, print
“No”.
6. Add a new worksheet called “Ticket Viewer”.
a. Formulate a way wherein a user can enter any ticket number, and the following
will be populated:
  i. Subject
  ii. From
  iii. Date Created
  iv. Priority


# Excel Pivot Tables and Charts

For this task, we will still use the data provided. Now, I’d like to have a representation of the
data using Pivot in Excel for an easier visualization and analysis of data. Based on the cleansed
file, can you please identify the following using Pivot table and graphs.

1. Add a new worksheet for Pivot Table and present the following:
a. Total Tickets per Team
b. Total Tickets per Priority

2. Add a new worksheet for Pivot Chart and present the following:
a. Total Tickets per Status

3. In the sheet with Pivot Chart, add slicers for the following:
a. Priority
b. Source
c. Type
d. Department
e. Breached SLA

# Powerpoint Presentation
Based on the reports and summaries you have prepared for the earlier tasks, 
please create a PowerPoint presentation and provide recommendations on how to improve support to fulfill the SLA.

# Google Looker Dashboard

Direct Link to my dashboard:
https://lookerstudio.google.com/reporting/8a2a934d-49d3-4ceb-bca6-acc6019ffa84 

1. Display total record count.
2. Add a pie chart displaying the summary of “ticket sources”.
3. Add a chart of your choice to represent the total tickets based on priority.
4. Add a chart of your choice to represent the total tickets based on ticket type.
5. Add 2 more charts or graphs that are deemed useful based on your own analysis.
6. Capture screenshots of your graphs and paste it in a document or slide. You can also
download the report as PDF and provide clear and concise summaries for each graph
